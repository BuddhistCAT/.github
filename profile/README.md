# Workflow Overview

## How it works?

This system of working is based on leveraging capabilities found in two technologies, Github and Transifex.

**Github** is the online service where all the project data is stored and where new projects are created. One comes to Github to start new projects, and to export projects into various file formats. 

**Transifex** is the online service where everything between starting a new project and wanting to publish it is handled. 

Github represents asset management (ingestion, segmenting, publishing).

Transifex represents translation management. 

Together they represent the entire translation project life-cycle from having the edition of the text to be translated ready for translation to having the translated text automatically formatted in various formats.

## Getting Started

#### Requirements

- Github account
- Discord account
- Transifex account

#### Step-by-Step

Assuming you already have Github, Discord, and Transifex accounts. Proceed with the following.

1) Become a member in BuddhistCAT Discord community by clicking [this invite link](https://discord.gg/4auZVfCEkU).
2) Request @aunt or @nt on Discord to add you as a member of this Github organization
3) Create a Github organization (unless you already have it) where your translation projects will be managed
4) Do the one-time integration between Github and Transifex following the instructions [here](https://github.com/apps/transifex-integration)
5) Create your first project after reading through the documentation titled [HOW-TO: Starting a New Project](https://github.com/BuddhistCAT/New-Project-Template/blob/main/documentation/README.md)

**NOTE:** In order to be able to access the **New Project Template** required for starting new projects as explained in the [HOW-TO: Starting a New Project](https://github.com/BuddhistCAT/New-Project-Template/blob/main/documentation/README.md), you will have to become a member of this Github organization first.
